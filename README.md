# Travelling-Salesman
A common logistics problem that optimizes a travelling salesman's path between all given nodes.

The Travelling salesman problem involves a number of points that are all randomly connected. The problem aims to optimize a shortest path
for the salesman to take, visiting all nodes. We do this through efficiently swapping nodes visited, seeing if the new swapped node distance
is shorter, and then saving the shortest path until we are reasonably confident the salesman is taking an optimal route.
